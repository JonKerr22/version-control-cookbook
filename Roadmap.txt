This document is for planning purposes only

State of app on 08/17/20
- Have some file structure for entities and services
- Can do basic intialization of a new user and first recipe
    - This includes a new user directory and txt files for user info and recipes
- Can access an existing user repo and view the commit messages
- I can find an existing repo and clone it to a new directory

Future TODOS
- Need to connect to a front end using angular and flask (this should be broken down more)
- Need to take compressed .git folder and generate user and recipe txt files from it (probably needs some more breakdown)
- Need to be able to view changes for each recipe
- Need to have multiple recipes with multiple changes for a single user
    - Basically create a "git log" equivalent on a single file
- Need some basic interaction with a users recipes
    - Do a first iteration of this as a console app
- In general should make a console app version of this before deploying to a local web app
- If running as local web app works out fine, figure out deploying to a Docker container
    - Docker container should fit into an AWS deploying process well
    - Will need a lot of front end work for local web app before deploying
